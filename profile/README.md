## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the **Data 4 Good (D4G)** GitHub organization at the University of Arizona! We are a community of undergraduate and graduate students dedicated to using data for positive social impact through the D4G Case Competition. Our teams leverage data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges while enhancing their skills through hands-on experience.

### 🙋‍♀️ What is our organization all about?

Our mission is to empower students to utilize data science and AI for the greater good, building innovative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems. Through collaboration, mentorship, and access to industry-level tools, students develop technical skills while contributing to meaningful projects.
